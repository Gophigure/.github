## Contribution Guidelines

We also have an expansive document detailing contribution guidelines, but they are more-so focused on Gophigure. If
you'd like to read them, you can do so
[here](https://github.com/Gophigure/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

While we'd love to provide an "At a Glance" section for our Contribution Guidelines, we believe the table of contents
contained within will be more than enough for most people, it also contains a section for guiding you to where you
should ask us questions.

***Thanks, and have fun!** — The Gophigure Team*
