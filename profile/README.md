Gophigure is an organization focused on developing a Discord bot, and the tools to both support and improve it.

### Gophigure

Gophigure is a Discord bot focused on delivering a speedy and efficient toolkit
for fun and utilities.

Gophigure's source isn't yet public, as the bot is yet to receive an overhaul as
our custom Go Discord module is still under works.

### Glyde

Glyde is our own Go module for interacting with both the Discord API and
Gateway. It's possibly the main reason you're here, and that's okay, it's being
made not only with our bot in mind, but for others to use in their own bots or
applications.

Unfortunately Glyde isn't ready for public use yet, and it's the reason our
bot's development has stagnated.

### Contribution Guidelines

We also have an expansive document detailing contribution guidelines, but they
are more-so focused on the bot. If you'd like to read them, you can do
so [here](https://github.com/Gophigure/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

While we'd love to provide an "At a Glance" section for our Contribution
Guidelines, we believe the table of contents contained within will be more than
enough for most people, it also contains a section for guiding you to where you
should ask us questions.
